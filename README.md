CycleGAN for Horse-to-Zebra Transformation

This repository implements CycleGAN, a powerful unsupervised image-to-image translation model, for transforming horse images into zebra images. The CycleGAN architecture facilitates the conversion between domains without paired training data, enabling the generation of realistic and diverse outputs.

Key Features:

Unsupervised Image Translation: CycleGAN allows domain-to-domain translation without requiring paired examples during training.

Horse-to-Zebra Transformation: Specifically configured for transforming images from the horse domain to the zebra domain.

Cycle-Consistency: Incorporates cycle-consistency loss to ensure high-quality and coherent translations.
